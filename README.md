I have done some coding for copying mulitple files/folders without changing thier names.There is'nt necessary for us to create new dir or
give name of the folder every time we copy a new file. Coding part takes care of it reducing burden on our shoulders. I have used threading module to decrease the time taking for copying files.


P.s:- I am new to coding. Changes to improve this file or better version of this file is utmost welcome.

Thank you  to whoever reading this file.
